    Read all features. When there are many, subsample them to a manageable number.

    Args:
        params (DataFrame): a one row DataFrame with named elements containing:
            instrument (str): name of the instrument that took the images.
            features (str): name of the feature extractor.
                both of the arguments above determine the file to read.
            n_obj_max (int): maximum number of obejcts to consider. If more are available from the file, subsample it to reduce the number. This will be considered as "all" the objects for the purpose of the analysis.
        log : the logger.

    Returns:
        ndarray: an array of shape nb of objects x nb of features containing the features.
